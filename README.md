# Highway-Path-Planning
Path planner that creates smooth, safe trajectories for an autonomous vehicle to follow along a 3 lane highway with traffic. The path planner is able to keep inside its lane, avoid hitting other cars, and pass slower moving traffic all by using localization, sensor fusion, and map data.

## Description
The car safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH off the 50 MPH speed limit. The highway has 6 lanes total - 3 heading in each direction. Each lane is 4 m wide and the car should only ever be in one of the 3 lanes on the right-hand side. The path planner is provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data. There is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car goes as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible. Other cars will try to change lanes too. The car avoids hitting other cars at all cost and is driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. Also the car does not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3 so that humans feel comfortable inside the car.

## Point Paths
The path planner outputs a list of x and y global map coordinates. Each pair of x and y coordinates is a point, and all of the points together form a trajectory. The first waypoint has an s value of 0 because it is the starting point.

The map of the highway is in `data/highway_map.txt`
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around. So the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it receives in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing between the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from one point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner receives should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 10 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.)

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Spline function

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using the spline function from http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/
The spline function in a single header file is really easy to use.

## Simulator
You can download the Simulator here: [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```
## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program:

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates.
